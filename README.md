# 7Bow
7Bow is a game design project that I worked on my second year of college. It started out as a one level vertical slice, but I ended up using it to help further my
understanding of Javascript and C#. It was also a great tool for learning about how to implement game mechanics from scratch as I tried to implement everything with
limited research. However, this version of the game is the final build.
